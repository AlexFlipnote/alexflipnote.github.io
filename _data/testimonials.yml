  text: God, I love this bot, xelA! She got what we all needed - for moderation, fun commands, music, etc. It's a life saver! Especially for a server with thousands of members to accommodate. What I love more about this bot is how neat her codes are and how helpful is her developer is. Trust me, you have to have this in your server and you won't regret it.
