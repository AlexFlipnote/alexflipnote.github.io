This is my personal website that is shown at https://alexflipnote.dev.

## How does it work?
This website is built using PHP and static HTML files. When pushing everything, I simply run `make build` which runs a custom-made PHP compiler to generate everything needed while also copying the necessary files to the output directory.

## Requirements
- PHP 8.4 or above
